# questiobn 1: What is List? How will you reverse a list?
# In python, a list is a type of sequence data structure that can hold an ordered
# collect which can be of any type(such as numbers, strings,or other objects).

# list are created using square brackets, and the elements are separated by commas.

# revers a list->for a reverse a list in python you can use reverse method 
# like mylist.reverse()

#Question 3: Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?

#append()
The append() method adds a single element to the end of a list. 
The element can be of any type, and it will be added as a new item in the list.

#extend()
The extend() method add multiple elements to the end of a list. 
It takes an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) as its argument, and adds each element in the iterable 
as a new item in the list.

#Question 5: How will you compare two lists?

You can compare two lists for equality using the == operator. 
This will return True if the two lists have the same elements in the same order, and otherwise False . 


#Question 18: What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

Tuples are an immutable data type, which means that once they have been generated, 
their elements cannot be changed.
Since tuples are ordered sequences, each element has a specific order that will never change.

#Difference between list and tuple.

Tuples are defined using parentheses, whereas lists are defined using square brackets. 
For example, a tuple might look like (1, 2, 3) while a list might look like [1, 2, 3].

Once a tuple is created, you can't add or remove elements from it or change the values of its elements. Tuples are immutable.
 
Lists are mutable and can be modified after they are created.


#Question 31: How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?

To create a dictionary using tuples in Python, you can use the built-in dict() function. 
The dict() function can take a list of tuples as an argument, where each tuple contains a 
key-value pair that will be added to the dictionary.


#Question 36: How Do You Check The Presence Of A Key In A Dictionary?

In Python, you can check the presence of a key in a dictionary using the in operator or the get() method. 


# question 43:Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

The zip() method is a built-in function in Python that is used to combine multiple iterables into a single iterable object. 
It takes one or more iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) as arguments, 
and returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables.


# question 52:How do you perform pattern matching in Python? Explain.

Built-in functions: These are functions that are built into the Python language print(), len(), sum(), type(), etc.
User-defined functions: These are functions that are created by users def
Anonymous or lambda functions: These are small, single-expression functions and defined using the lambda keyword.


# question 56:How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers?

In Python, you can set the starting value, also known as the seed value, 
for generating random numbers using the random.seed() function.


#Question 57: How will you randomizes the items of a list in place?

In Python, you can randomize the items of a list in place using the random module and the list method shuffle().
