# 1] Reversing a number using a while loop
# 2] Create a strong password with following given rules
# - At least 12 characters (required for your Muhlenberg password)â€”the more characters, the better
# - A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
# - A mixture of letters and numbers 
# - Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ] 
# 3] Guess the Number Game
# - Set a random winning_num every time the program is executed.
# - Print 'Low' if the guessed number is lower than the winning number, or 'High' if the guessed number is higher than the winning number.
# - If the guessed number (guess_num) and the winning number (winning_num) are the same, then print 'Congratulations, you have won! You guessed it in [number of attempts] attempts.
# - Begin the same game again after it has been won or lost.
# 4] W.A.P that finds the longest palindromic substring within a given string.
# 5]  Given a list of strings, group the anagrams together.
# 	Example:
# 	Input: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
# 	Output: [["eat","tea"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]
# 6] Implement "next permutation" to find the next greater permutation.
# 	Example:
# 	Input: [1,2,3]
# 	Output: [1,3,2] 
# 7]  Given a list of numbers, find all unique triplets that sum to zero.
# 	Example:
# 	Input: [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# 	Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
# 8] Rotate a list to the right by k steps.
# 	Example:
# 	Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
# 	Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# 9] Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
# 	Example:
# 	Input: [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
# 	Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
# 10] Reverse the order of words in a sentence while maintaining the order of characters within each word.
